# Smaller combat result icons for Emperor of the Fading Suns.

This mod replaces the skull and flag graphics, displayed over a unit as it dies or runs away in combat, with smaller icons which do not interfere with recognition of the affected unit.

  2. Extract both the ```mod.ini``` file and ```MOD``` folder directly into your root Emperor of the Fading Suns folder.
  3. You're done!

##### If you *are* using other mods already:

  3. Open the file ```mod.ini``` located in the root folder and add 'SmallerSkull' on a new line.

### Can I redistribute this in my own mod?
Yes!
