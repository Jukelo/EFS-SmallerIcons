# Smaller combat result icons for Emperor of the Fading Suns.

This mod replaces the skull and flag graphics, displayed over a unit as it dies or runs away in combat, with smaller icons which do not interfere with recognition of the affected unit.

### How do I install this?

Emperor of the Fading Suns version 1.5 or newer is needed [^1].

##### If you are using no other mod:
  1. Open the [```SmallerSkull.zip```](SmallerSkull.zip) archive 
  2. Extract both the ```mod.ini``` file and ```MOD``` folder directly into your root Emperor of the Fading Suns folder
  3. You're done!

##### If you *are* using another mod already you need to merge the two:
  1. Open the ```SmallerSkull.zip``` archive, and navigate to the ```MOD\SmallerSkull``` subfolder.
  2. Extract the ```BIN``` folder therein directly into your existing mod's folder in the game's MOD folder. If your mod is called *MyMod*, this would be ```Emperor of the Fading Suns\MOD\MyMod\```
  3. Do not extract ```mod.ini```
  4. Enjoy!
  
  Note that Nova 2.4 and Emperor Wars 4.0 already include this mod.

### Can I redistribute this in my own mod?
Yes!

[^1]: Older versions of EFS are modded by directly overwriting the game's files. The files in question are BIN\SKULL.BIN and BIN\FLAG.BIN.
